# About CEX System

## What is CEX?

CEX (Comfort, Efficiency, Aesthetics) is a standardized rating system designed to evaluate airports based on both objective and subjective criteria. The system provides a comprehensive score between 0 and 10 that represents the overall quality of an airport from a user experience perspective.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to create a transparent, reliable, and standardized way to measure and compare airport quality worldwide. By providing objective data and subjective assessments in a structured format, we aim to:

1. Help travelers make informed decisions about their journeys
2. Provide feedback to airport operators for continuous improvement
3. Create a global benchmark for airport quality
4. Encourage healthy competition among airports to enhance user experience

## The CEX Methodology

The CEX rating is based on three main pillars:

### Comfort (C)

Evaluates the physical comfort and amenities available to travelers:
- Seating and rest areas (Sp)
- Air conditioning and climate control (Ac)
- Dining options and food quality (Da)
- Quiet zones and noise management (Zl)

### Efficiency (E)

Measures how well the airport functions in terms of operations:
- Transit options and connectivity (To)
- Navigation and wayfinding (Ng)
- Processing times (security, check-in, etc.) (Rt)
- Mobility and accessibility features (Pm)

### Aesthetics (X)

Assesses the visual and sensory experience of the airport:
- Visual appeal and architecture (Va)
- Interior design and materials (Id)
- Spatial configuration and layout (Sc)
- Lighting and atmosphere (Lu)

Each component is rated on a scale of 0-10, and the final CEX score is calculated using a weighted average of the three pillars.

## Who We Are

The CEX System was developed by a team of aviation enthusiasts, UX designers, and data scientists passionate about improving the travel experience. Our diverse backgrounds allow us to approach airport evaluation from multiple perspectives, ensuring a comprehensive assessment methodology.
